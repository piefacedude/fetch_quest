-- Motion Planning --
* Attack: Jump
Character is going to move across the screen to just in front of the enemy (80%?)
Character Jumps, traveling just above the head of the enemy before landing on it's head
?? SPLIT ??
Character bounces, arcing the same distance into the air as the first jump, before hitting
the enemy's head again.

OR // THEN

Character bounces backwards in the same arc (backwards)
Character runs to starting positions

CODE:
stage 1:
find difference between character's bottom position, and the enemy's.
distance / time to walk = speed in x
end stage 1

stage 2:
find difference between character's bottom potion and the enemy's head
x dif is the x speed
y speed = difference + 10%, with acceleration pulling it down to the creature's head (10%?)
end stage 2

stage 3:
if (QTE = done) {
10% of screen, same as height of jump on with down acel = 10% * 2 / time OR when foot y = head y
end stage 3
}
else {
end stage 3
}

stage 4:
diff in x & x + 10%, same acel down, x acel * -1
end stage 4

stage 5:
end vel of 4 / 2, same down, for 3
end stage 5

stage 6:
end x - current x / time as stage 1 - 20% (bounces)
end stage 6
